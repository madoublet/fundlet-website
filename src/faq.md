## Campaigns and Setup

<details class="faq-item">
<summary>How do I create and activate a new campaign?</summary>

**Short answer:** Campaigns are created and activated directly inside the Fundlet app.

**Details:**

A Fundlet campaign works much like a Shopify page or product. To launch one:

- Go to **Campaign List**
- Click **Add a Campaign**
- Configure campaign details (name, description, images, goals, payouts)
- Click **Activate**

Once activated, the campaign is immediately live and ready to accept orders.

</details>

<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What is the campaign limit?</summary>

**Short answer:** Paid plans allow unlimited campaigns; the free plan allows up to 2 active campaigns.

**Details:**

- **Paid plans:** Unlimited active campaigns  
- **Free plan:** 2 active campaigns  

Inactive campaigns do not count toward your plan limits.

</details>

<details class="faq-item">
<summary>What happens if a campaign exceeds its plan’s order limit?</summary>

**Short answer:** Your campaign continues running and you’ll be prompted to upgrade.

**Details:**

- No active campaigns are paused
- No orders are lost
- You can upgrade at any time to continue tracking new orders

This ensures fundraisers are never disrupted mid-campaign.

</details>

<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Can I use Fundlet with my existing storefront or collections?</summary>

**Short answer:** Yes—Fundlet is designed to integrate seamlessly with your existing Shopify store.

**Details:**

You can use Fundlet with:
- Existing product pages
- Shopify collection pages
- Embedded widgets
- Redirects from older pages to campaign pages

This allows you to launch fundraisers without restructuring your store.

</details>

<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Why don’t some product images (like sizing charts) appear in the campaign pop-up?</summary>

**Short answer:** Fundlet displays **variant-level images**, not just main product images.

**Details:**

If images are missing:
- Ensure images are assigned to each product **variant**
- Not only the main product gallery

This is common with sizing charts, colors, or style-specific imagery.

<details class="faq-item">
<summary>Why is the “Customize” button missing when creating a template?</summary>

**Details:**

The functionality is the same—the label was updated by Shopify.
