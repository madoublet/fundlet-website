## 🛒 Discount Design

By default, Fundlet tracks orders using a discount code. It applies this discount on the campaign or product page depending on how you have your fundraiser configured. But, some discounts like **automatic discounts** get applied after the Fundlet campaign page. This will override the Fundlet discount code. If you want to allow automatic discounts to work alongside your Fundlet discount, you will have to enable discount stacking both on the automatic discount and the Fundlet discount code. This can be done in the discount code page in Shopify or by pulling up the discount blade in the Edit Campaign page. If you do not want to allow automatic discounts, you will need to scope your automatic discounts to not include products in the Fundlet campaign. A good way to do this is by creating unlisted products specifically for your fundraising products and excluding them from the automatic discount scope.

## 🏷️ Product Design

When using Fundlet, you can choose to use your existing products or create new products for fundraising. This depends on a number of factors including discount codes and pricing. If you choose to create unique products for your fundraiser, we recommend using the unlisted status so the products do not show as duplicates in existing collections or in your product search.

## 🎨 Site Design

Fundlet is built directly into your Shopify site. This allows you to embed a fundraiser directly into your existing site design with little effort. However, this does allow the customer to shop your entire site at the same time. Some shops love this feature while others want a more focused experience. That is why Fundlet provides both the capability to embed the fundraiser into your existing design and run an isolated fundraiser.
