## Step 2: Onboard Participants

## Step 3: Grow Sales with Coupon Codes  

Beyond fundraising, Fundlet doubles as a marketing tool. You can use coupon codes to extend your fundraiser across your entire store. This turns every purchase into an opportunity to raise money and helps grow revenue for your existing product line.
